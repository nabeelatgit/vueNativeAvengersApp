                The Scarlet Witch is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in The X-Men #4 (March 1964) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. She is first portrayed as a supervillain along with her twin brother Quicksilver as a founding member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. In most depictions, she is portrayed as a mutant, a member of a fictional subspecies of humans born with superhuman abilities, and, for much of the character's history, was considered the daughter of the mutant Magneto. The Scarlet Witch possesses abilities to alter reality in unspecified ways and is a powerful sorceress. The Scarlet Witch is later depicted as a regular member of the Avengers superhero team. She also becomes the wife of fellow superhero and teammate Vision, with whom she has two sons, Thomas and William.
