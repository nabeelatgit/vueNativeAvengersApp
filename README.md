# vueNativeAvengersApp
Avengers Wiki App created using Vue Native

This is a basic version of Vue Native where I created this for my learning purpose. I also went through a tutorial. Link below. I have implemented an app where the home screen shows all Marvel character names and their details once you click on them using router.

Pre-requisites for running the App:-
1) Install Expo (for running it in your smartphone)
2) Node Version > 10
3) Npm Version > 6.4.*
4) Clone the repository
5) Perform "npm install"
6) Run the app by "npm start"
7) This will open a browser with a QR code. Scan the code using the expo app and see the app in your smartphone.
